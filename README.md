# Machine Learning Using Python - K-means Clustering
Who will buy more?

In this project, I leveraged simulated data to create a predictive model for analyzing consumer behavior in a market. By creating a target market segment, specifically cluster 0, I identified individuals with substantial purchasing power due to their high income. These customers possess greater funds and an increased capacity to spend.

The dataset owner can leverage this valuable information to effectively group new customers into the appropriate cluster, determining whether they fit the target customer profile or not. Additionally, I highly recommended that the client focused their marketing efforts on customers with children and a higher income. This strategic approach aimed to maximize profits and attract a larger customer base, leading to greater success for my client.
